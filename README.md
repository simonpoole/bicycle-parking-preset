## Bicycle preset with large images

This is the standard bicycle preset from [Beautified JOSM Preset](https://github.com/simonpoole/beautified-JOSM-preset) 
enhanced with large images for type selection in [Vespucci](https://vespucci.io/).

The current images are from the [City of ZÃ¼richs bicycle infrastructure map](https://www.maps.stadt-zuerich.ch/zueriplan3/stadtplan.aspx)

Building the preset files is done with gradle and should work on both unixy operations systems and windows, the "generateAllPresetTypes" task will generate the variants in the `gen` directory.

Building requires `xmlstarlet` installed and on your path, generating the icons from SVG requires `rsvg-convert`to be installed.
